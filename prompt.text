"Generate a responsive and animated e-commerce Shop Page for a website called 'ShobBazaar', built with React, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The design must follow this UI theme: Primary color: #F97316, Secondary: #10B981, Accent: #1D4ED8, Text: #1F2937, Background: #F9FAFB.

Include:

A product grid using real-world categories for the Bangladeshi market like Mobile Phones, Grocery, Fashion, Electronics, and Kitchen.

Fake product data in JSON (e.g., 'Samsung Galaxy A14', 'Fresh Atta 2kg', 'Panasonic Rice Cooker', etc.) with image URLs, price, category, and rating.

A filter sidebar with options to filter by:

✅ Category (checkboxes or dropdown)

✅ Price range (slider or input fields)

✅ Minimum rating (stars or select)

A search bar with autocomplete (suggestion dropdown as you type product names).

Use Framer Motion for entrance animations of filters and product cards.

Make the layout responsive: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3–4 on desktop.

Provide all code in a single modular component, and use reusable components for product card, filter item, and search bar. Avoid external UI libraries besides Tailwind, Framer Motion, and icons like React Icons."**
